## Description

Rent a Car is a modern web application designed to offer a seamless and engaging car rental experience. The application features a sleek, interactive carousel that showcases a variety of cars available for rent. Each car is displayed with high-quality images and detailed information, allowing users to easily explore and choose their preferred vehicle.

### Key Features

- **Interactive Carousel**: The main feature of the application is a dynamic carousel that automatically cycles through a selection of cars. Users can manually navigate through the carousel and view each car in detail. The carousel incorporates smooth animations to enhance user experience.

- **Car Details**: Each car in the carousel can be selected to reveal detailed information. Clicking the "Details" button triggers a transition effect that displays a comprehensive overview of the chosen car, including specifications such as engine type, horsepower, fuel type, and more.

- **Responsive Design**: The application is fully responsive and adapts to various screen sizes, ensuring a consistent experience across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices. The layout adjusts dynamically to provide an optimal viewing experience.

- **Mobile Navigation Menu**: On mobile devices, users can access a hamburger menu that slides in from the side. This menu provides quick access to different sections of the site, including Home, Offer, Contact, and About Us pages.

- **Social Media Integration**: The application includes a sidebar on larger screens and a section within the mobile menu that provides easy access to the project's social media profiles. Users can connect with the brand on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and LinkedIn.

- **Modern UI/UX**: The interface is designed with modern aesthetics in mind, using clean lines, vibrant colors, and intuitive navigation. The use of Tailwind CSS ensures a visually appealing and cohesive design throughout the application.
